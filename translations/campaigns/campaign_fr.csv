MISSION_DESR_MAYDAY_SQUARE,"Après des jours de contestation, les limites de notre patience sont atteintes. La corruption et les abus doivent cesser. Les manifestants du square Mayday sont prêts à se battre ! Prenez le commandement et donnez l'assaut au palais présidentiel."
MISSION_1_OFFICER_INTRO,"Sir! We are ready to begin the assault on the Presidental Palace! Our troops are awaiting your orders."
MISSION_1_OFFICER_OBJECTIVE,"This is the enemy HQ. We need to bring our soldiers there and capture it. Without central command, military forces guarding the Palace will disperse."
MISSION_1_OFFICER_TOWER_1,"We should also claim as many communication towers as possible to gain more resources for our operations. Those are crucial, as we need to pay for the deployment of new units, and movement of those already in the field."
MISSION_1_OFFICER_TOWER_2,"Our enemy is already capturing nearby towers, we need to hurry and take them back to gain advantage!"
MISSION_1_SOLDIER_SHOUT,"You are outnumbered! Stand down and let us get that corrupted bastard!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_ORDER,"Fall back soldier!"
MISSION_1_GUARD,"Rebel scum!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_COMMAND,"Sir! Our forces are on the edge, we need you to take command!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_NEARBY,"Palace defence HQ is close. Let's take it!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_DEFEND,"Sir! Enemy forces are getting dangerously close to our HQ! We should drive them back, otherwise we risk loosing this battle!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_DEPLOY,"Our forces have taken significant losses. We should deploy more soldiers from our HQ."
MISSION_DESR_EASTERN_CITY,"Les événements récents ont permis un changement relativement pacifique de gouvernement, il existe malgré tout des tensions. Un groupe de militants loyaux à l'ancien président a été localisé. Capturez les avant qu'ils ne provoquent une guerre civile."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_INTRO,"Sir, recently we've been getting reports of increased militia activity in this region. We suspect there might be an organized command centre nearby. We should investigate."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS,"Our forces are limited here. We should secure these infantry barracks. This building will enable us to deploy new soldiers for a lower price."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_TIPOFF,"Sir! We just got a tip off from local civilians indicating the location of the militia HQ. This is our objective."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_CAPTURED_1,"Great work, Sir."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_CAPTURED_2,"Please be advised, that claiming buildings other than communication towers will require our soldier to stay inside, so make sure we always have enough infantry on the battlefield."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_CAPTURED_3,"There were some recruits waiting in the barracks. They have joined us."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_TIP_1,"Deploying more units will cost us resources, same as moving them. Spend them wisely."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_TIP_2,"In order to deploy a unit, dedicated spawn tile next to the building must be free. If one of your units occupies that tile, you have to move it first."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_TIP_3,"You can use this to your advantage as well. Blocking spawn tiles next to enemy buildings will prevent them from deploying reinforcements."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_ALARM,"They have found us! Raise the alarm!"
MISSION_DESR_RIOTS,"L'actuel gouvernement est arrivé au pouvoir en attaquant notre leader. Et ils osent nous qualifier de rebelles ! Les nouvelles autorités sont encore faibles. Nous devons saisir cette occasion pour occuper les administrations. Nos forces attendent vos ordres !"
MISSION_3_OFFICER_INTRO_1,"Welcome, Commander. Apologies for the delays."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_INTRO_2,"We finally managed to set up a camp. Wasn't easy to gather troops after we lost controll of the army."
MISSION_3_OBJECTIVE,"Our objective is to take the City Hall. Local defense forces are still disorganized. We should use this window of opportunity."
MISSION_3_TANK_1,"Our militiants managed to steal a tank from nearby military base. It won't be long before someone notices."
MISSION_3_TANK_2,"Tanks are great at dealing with infantry - this one will be a valuble asset in this mission. Still, we need more if we are to succeed."
MISSION_3_TANK_FACTORY,"There is a tank fabrication facility nearby. Take it before the enemy uses those heavy units to stop our assault."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_FACTORY_CAP_1,"Great work, Commander. Nothing will stop us now."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_FACTORY_CAP_2,"Local defense forces ordered a tank recently. I guess it is ours now."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_FACTORY_AI,"Commander, this is not good! Local forces have taken active controll of this factory. We need to re-take it, or we will face a lot more tanks that we can handle."
MISSION_DESR_BASE_ASSAULT,"Notre récente victoire nous a donné confiance, mais nous ne devons pas en rester là. La base à proximité possède de l'équipement que nous pourrions utiliser ! Nous devons attaquer avant qu'ils réalisent qu'ils ne contrôlent plus cette région."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_INTRO_1,"Great work on securing a foothold Commander, but our work here is not yet done."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_INTRO_2,"If we are to secure our presence in this region, we have to take over the military base."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_INTRO_3,"Armoured units are available. Expect the enemy base to deploy tanks of their own!"
MISSION_4_OFFICER_LANDLINE_1,"We've managed to cut off their landline communications, Commander. We should be able to overwhelm them before they can even call for help."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_LANDLINE_2,"Still, we should not waste any time. They can still use comm towers."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_HELP_1,"This is perimeter base! We are under attack! Repeat, we are under attack!"
MISSION_4_OFFICER_HELP_2,"This is not good, they managed to restore communications. We have to prepare for reinforcements."
MISSION_4_RAPID_RESPONSE,"Rapid response unit reporting in!"
MISSION_4_FORWARD_BARRACK,"Capturing these forward barracks would allow us to bring soldiers to the front line more easily."
MISSION_4_GUARD_WARN,"Rebels are getting close!"
MISSION_4_COMM_CUT_1,"With both towers near their HQ we knocked out their comms completely."
MISSION_4_COMM_CUT_2,"What the... ? Command, come in. Anyone?"
MISSION_4_COMM_CUT_3,"Good luck with that."
MISSION_DESR_PENINSULA,"Ces derniers jours de combat ont été payants. Nous avons maintenant le soutien de notre puissant pays voisin. Nous sommes prêts à expulser les usurpateurs de la péninsule. Ils n'auront aucun moyen de la reprendre et ce sera une belle victoire !"
MISSION_5_OFFICER_INTRO_1,"Government forces throughout the peninsula are busy fighting local militia."
MISSION_5_OFFICER_INTRO_2,"With a cooridnated push, we can take controll of this land before they can re-organize."
MISSION_5_OFFICER_INTRO_3,"This base safeguards a strategic route connecting the peninsula with the rest of the country. Taking controll of this facility will cut off all remaining army, forcing them to surrender."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_NEAR_1,"This is an airforce outpost meant to support the main base. Defences seem to be minimal, they did not expect an attack from this direction."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_NEAR_2,"We should claim this building for additional air support."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_CAP_1,"There is more equipment here, than we expected. They probably regret loosing this outpost already."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_CAP_2,"Attack helicopter reporting for duty."
MISSION_5_FLANK,"With the right flank secured, we were able to bring in some reinforcements."
MISSION_5_BLOCK_1,"You will not get away with this, traitors!"
MISSION_5_BLOCK_2,"It is you, who betrayed our great President! Arrest him!"
MISSION_DESR_RECAPTURE,"La situation se détériore rapidement. Nous devons les repousser, sinon nous perdrons tout ce que nous avons gagné jusqu'ici. Nous sommes prêts à libérer la ville où se trouvent les rebelles. Montrons leurs qu'ils ne font pas le poids face à nous."
MISSION_6_INTRO_1,"Welcome, Sir. As you may already know, recent setbacks have put us in an unfavourable position. We have to start pushing back."
MISSION_6_INTRO_2,"Our intel suggests, that this city is where it all started. Rebel activity appears to have lessened since the initial attack - they probably moved on."
MISSION_6_INTRO_3,"Still, we should not underestimate the garrison stationed here. Liberating this city will be an important step in our campaign."
MISSION_6_INTRO_4,"Sir, the base of operations is up and running."
MISSION_6_INTRO_5,"Good."
MISSION_6_INTRO_6,"Air support reporting in."
MISSION_6_INTRO_7,"We've got decent amount of ground units, though our air capabilities are limited for this engagement. Use these assets well."
MISSION_6_APP_BASE,"Sir, this looks like an abandoned rebel encampment. It seems they had no way of moving all this equipment, so they just left it."
MISSION_6_APP_TOWERS_1,"There are two comm towers on the left flank."
MISSION_6_APP_TOWERS_2,"There may be some AA emplacements in the area, but if we capture those towers, we will be able to guide in more air support safely."
MISSION_6_APP_TOWERS_3,"Anti-tank team has arrived."
MISSION_6_PATROL_1,"Patrol squad reporting back."
MISSION_6_PATROL_2,"No rest for you, we are under attack!"
MISSION_6_RED_HQ_1,"We are loosing ground! Warn the Commander!"
MISSION_6_RED_HQ_2,"Yes Sir!"
MISSION_6_RED_HQ_3,"He got away. Doesn't matter, let's focus on the mission at hand."
MISSION_DESR_BASE_DEFENCE,"Alerte ! Les rebelles attaquent une de nos bases militaires à l'est du pays ! Nous devons les empêcher de capturer une autre de nos positions stratégiques. Défendez la base et éliminez les forces rebelles dans la région."
MISSION_7_INTRO_1,"Alarm! Unidentified troops spotted near the base perimeter!"
MISSION_7_INTRO_2,"They spotted us! Commence the attack!"
MISSION_7_INTRO_3,"Sir! We had reports of enemy movements in the area, but we did not expect them to organize so fast."
MISSION_7_INTRO_4,"And they are taking the auxilary barracks! Tank factory is probably being attacked as well. We have to protect our flanks."
MISSION_7_LEFT_CLAIMED,"Left flank secure."
MISSION_7_RIGHT_CLAIMED,"Right flank secure."
MISSION_7_TRAP,"We've got you now!"
MISSION_7_BASE_1,"You might think you are winning, but this is only a minor setback. We will be back, and in greater numbers!"
MISSION_7_BASE_2,"We will see about that."
MISSION_7_TOWERS_1,"We've managed to take over enemy communication line and intercept some chatter about plans on attacking an airport."
MISSION_7_TOWERS_2,"This cannot be good..."
MISSION_DESR_AIRPORT_PT_1,"Nos combats contre les forces gouvernementales ne se déroulent pas aussi bien que prévu. Nous devons montrer au monde que nous ne baissons cependant pas les bras. L'aéroport voisin n'est pas stratégique mais sa prise sera un signe de notre puissance !"
MISSION_8_INTRO_1,"Forward camp is ready, Commander."
MISSION_8_INTRO_2,"Commander, let's get going."
MISSION_8_INTRO_3,"This is the local airport. It is not of high strategic importance, but loosing it will strike fear into enemies hearts."
MISSION_8_FACTORIES,"Reiconessanse reports multiple tank factories in the area. Those helicopters will come really handy."
MISSION_8_APP_AIRPORT,"Target spotted."
MISSION_8_CAP_AIRPORT_1,"Objective achieved."
MISSION_8_CAP_AIRPORT_2,"Now let's clear this area of enemy units, we can't risk loosing this terminal."
MISSION_8_BUY_HELI_1,"Let's clear those tanks."
MISSION_8_BUY_HELI_2,"Commander, while searching the airport we have found some documents left by the enemy officers."
MISSION_8_BUY_HELI_3,"It is some kind of flight schedule, probably for military supplies. We will make good use of this."
MISSION_DESR_AIRPLANE,"Grâce à l'équipement de l'aéroport, nous avons intercepté un message signalant un important avion militaire. Nous avons trouvé une zone de tir idéale pour lancer un missile et le descendre, mais elle est gardée par les ennemis. À l'attaque !"
MISSION_9_INTRO_1,"If the information we aquired is correct, there should be a military plane flying over this area soon."
MISSION_9_INTRO_2,"We have identified best position to set up our AA emplacement, but it is currently occupied by the enemy."
MISSION_9_INTRO_3,"Our camp is still being developed. We have to capture facilities available throughout the city to bolster our forces."
MISSION_9_TURN2_1,"Long range radar that we captured on the peninsula just reported it is tracking a vessel coming from the west."
MISSION_9_TURN2_2,"We still have plenty of time, but we have to finish our mission before the window of opportunity closes."
MISSION_9_TURN10_1,"The tracked vessel is closing in, we should hurry."
MISSION_9_TURN10_2,"We are also tracking a group of attack helicopters. They might be heading your way."
MISSION_9_TURN15_1,"The transport will be passing over any minute. We can still catch it."
MISSION_9_TURN15_2,"Eagle Squad ready for patrol duty... What is this? The base is under siege! Attack formation!"
MISSION_9_TURN18_1,"That airplane is already past our position. We have to prepare the attack now."
MISSION_9_TURN20_1,"The target is out of reach. We have failed, Commander."
MISSION_9_APP_HQ,"Closing in on the designated area. AA guns ready for deployment."
MISSION_DESR_FIELD_COMMAND,"Les séparatistes viennent de détruire un avion civil, des centaines de personnes sont mortes. Nous devons les stopper ! Nos éclaireurs ont trouvé leur QG local. Nos ressources sont limitées mais nous rassemblerons des troupes dans la ville voisine."
MISSION_10_INTRO_1,"Those fanatics just destroyed a civilian plane full of people! With ground-to-air missiles! Where did they even got this kind of equipment?"
MISSION_10_INTRO_2,"We have to stop this madness before more people suffer."
MISSION_10_INTRO_3,"Recon, do you have anything for us?"
MISSION_10_INTRO_4,"Local command center located, Sir. Attempting infiltration..."
MISSION_10_INTRO_5,"Not so fast!"
MISSION_10_INTRO_6,"We have been spotted! I repeat..."
MISSION_10_INTRO_7,"Now they know we're here. Looks like we have to assault this base old-fashioned way."
MISSION_10_TOWER_1,"Comms established. Requesting backup."
MISSION_10_TOWER_2,"Somebody called?"
MISSION_10_HQ_1,"Closing in on enemy position. They are surrounded by mountains, nowhere to go!"
MISSION_10_HQ_2,"Enemy reinforcements detected!"
MISSION_DESR_AIRPORT_PT_2,"Les forces rebelles se sont dispersées après la perte de leur QG local. L'aéroport est toujours fortement gardé mais ils ne recevront pas de renforts de sitôt. Nos éclaireurs ont mis en place une petite base. Nous devons attaquer avant qu'ils ne s'organisent."
MISSION_11_INTRO_1,"Welcome back, Sir.  We have finally got a green light on re-taking that airport."
MISSION_11_INTRO_2,"This area is highly contested. Luckily, our recent victories forced our foe to re-group, so they can't expect help anytime soon."
MISSION_11_RECON_1,"This is recon. We have located enemy HQ. Looks like they are fortifying their position."
MISSION_11_RECON_2,"Moving out before they spot us."
MISSION_11_CAP_TOWER,"Sir, the forest road is blocked. It looks like we could clear it out if we brought a tank here."
MISSION_11_TANK,"Load main gun! Fire!"
MISSION_DESR_CONVOY,"De nombreuses personnes souffrent en ces temps de guerre. Notre voisin voudrait nous envoyer nourriture et médicaments, mais le gouvernement ne croit pas à nos bonnes intentions et ne laisse pas passer le convoi. Nous devons libérer le passage !"
MISSION_12_INTRO_1,"The transports will be ready to go very soon."
MISSION_12_INTRO_2,"Nearby city really needs what's in these trucks. We have to secure the road."
MISSION_12_INTRO_3,"Capturing and holding these towers along the way should allow us to go safely."
MISSION_12_CROSSROAD_1,"This mountain pass is vital to our operation. We have to hold this position."
MISSION_12_CROSSROAD_2,"The enemy base is going to put a pressure on us from the flank. Take it out if you can, but do not compromise our mission, Commander."
MISSION_12_TOWERS_1,"Congratulations on securing the route. Now we should be able to co-ordinate our forces and defend the convoy."
MISSION_12_TOWERS_2,"They will not stop us."
MISSION_DESR_CRASH_SITE,"L'avion que nous avons abattu s'est écrasé dans la forêt. Personne ne doit pouvoir rejoindre le site du crash car sans les débris, personne ne pourra savoir qui l'a détruit ni comment. Les enquêteurs internationaux sont en route, nous devons les arrêter."
MISSION_13_INTRO_1,"Commander, I assume you already heard about our little... mistake."
MISSION_13_INTRO_2,"As it turns out, that military transport we shot down wasn't a military vessel at all."
MISSION_13_INTRO_3,"We have managed to blockade the crash site for now, but international investigators are on their way."
MISSION_13_INTRO_4,"Secure this position, Commander."
MISSION_13_TURN3_1,"Armoured column, move forward."
MISSION_13_TURN3_2,"Get out of our way, and we might just let you withdraw your forces... for now."
MISSION_13_TURN3_3,"Save your breath."
MISSION_13_HALF_WAY,"Sir, we have scouted an airfield near the enemy HQ. We have to be cautious when pushing with tanks."
MISSION_DESR_AIRPORT_PT_3,"Cela fait des mois que nous nous battons pour ce tas de ruines qu'est maintenant cet aéroport, son terminal, sa tour de contrôle, la ville avoisinante... Nous devons malgré tout le tenir car il montre que nous contrôlons la situation !"
MISSION_14_INTRO_1,"My apologies, Commander. We lost the airport you previously secured. Enemy attack was switft and devastating."
MISSION_14_INTRO_2,"We don't have much footing here. Taking control of the barracks building on the other side of the forest is a good start."
MISSION_14_INTRO_3,"I've dispatched a couple of small squads to scout out the battlefield ahead."
MISSION_14_TURN2_1,"We have some initial reports."
MISSION_14_TURN2_2,"The old encampment is ruined, though some light weapons for infantry can be salvaged for training more troops."
MISSION_14_TURN2_3,"Tank factory has been abandoned when it lost power, but we should be able to restore basic functions."
MISSION_14_TURN3_1,"Most of the city is completely ruined."
MISSION_14_TURN3_2,"Airport buildings have been blown up, not much left in there. Military hangars seem fairly untouched, we should be able to use them."
MISSION_14_TURN4_1,"We have visual confirmation on one of the enemy encampments. Looks like their command centre is not here."
MISSION_14_TURN4_2,"I think they spotted us, falling back."
MISSION_14_TURN4_3,"It's a trap!"
MISSION_14_TRAP_1,"Commander, we have found explosive traps in most of the buildings. They really didn't want us to capture it."
MISSION_14_TRAP_2,"And it seems, that explosions alerted them. Expect increased resistance."
