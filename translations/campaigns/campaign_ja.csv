MISSION_TITLE_MAYDAY_SQUARE,"メーデー広場"
MISSION_DESR_MAYDAY_SQUARE,"抗議の日の後、我々は最終的に満足と言おう。 腐敗と弾圧を止めなければならない！ メーデー広場の抗議者たちは戦う準備ができている！ 自由闘士の指揮をとり、大統領宮殿を攻撃する。"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_INTRO,"Sir! We are ready to begin the assault on the Presidental Palace! Our troops are awaiting your orders."
MISSION_1_OFFICER_OBJECTIVE,"This is the enemy HQ. We need to bring our soldiers there and capture it. Without central command, military forces guarding the Palace will disperse."
MISSION_1_OFFICER_TOWER_1,"We should also claim as many communication towers as possible to gain more resources for our operations. Those are crucial, as we need to pay for the deployment of new units, and movement of those already in the field."
MISSION_1_OFFICER_TOWER_2,"Our enemy is already capturing nearby towers, we need to hurry and take them back to gain advantage!"
MISSION_1_SOLDIER_SHOUT,"You are outnumbered! Stand down and let us get that corrupted bastard!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_ORDER,"Fall back soldier!"
MISSION_1_GUARD,"Rebel scum!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_COMMAND,"Sir! Our forces are on the edge, we need you to take command!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_NEARBY,"Palace defence HQ is close. Let's take it!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_DEFEND,"Sir! Enemy forces are getting dangerously close to our HQ! We should drive them back, otherwise we risk loosing this battle!"
MISSION_1_OFFICER_DEPLOY,"Our forces have taken significant losses. We should deploy more soldiers from our HQ."
MISSION_TITLE_EASTERN_CITY,"東部の都市"
MISSION_DESR_EASTERN_CITY,"メーデー広場のイベントが比較的平和な政権交代を許したとしても、まだ多くの緊張がある。 旧大統領に忠実な武装集団の報告がある。 彼らの行動が内戦を引き起こす前に、彼らの活動の中心を見つけて捕らえろ。"
MISSION_2_OFFICER_INTRO,"Sir, recently we've been getting reports of increased militia activity in this region. We suspect there might be an organized command centre nearby. We should investigate."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS,"Our forces are limited here. We should secure these infantry barracks. This building will enable us to deploy new soldiers for a lower price."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_TIPOFF,"Sir! We just got a tip off from local civilians indicating the location of the militia HQ. This is our objective."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_CAPTURED_1,"Great work, Sir."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_CAPTURED_2,"Please be advised, that claiming buildings other than communication towers will require our soldier to stay inside, so make sure we always have enough infantry on the battlefield."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_CAPTURED_3,"There were some recruits waiting in the barracks. They have joined us."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_TIP_1,"Deploying more units will cost us resources, same as moving them. Spend them wisely."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_TIP_2,"In order to deploy a unit, dedicated spawn tile next to the building must be free. If one of your units occupies that tile, you have to move it first."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_BARRACKS_TIP_3,"You can use this to your advantage as well. Blocking spawn tiles next to enemy buildings will prevent them from deploying reinforcements."
MISSION_2_OFFICER_ALARM,"They have found us! Raise the alarm!"
MISSION_TITLE_RIOTS,"暴動"
MISSION_DESR_RIOTS,"現政府は我々の親愛なる指導者を攻撃して力を発揮している！ 彼らは我々を敢えて反逆者と呼んでいる！ 新しい当局は依然として弱い。 この機会に、重要な管理本部を引き継ぐべきだ。 我々の軍隊は準備を整えて、あなたの命令を待機している！"
MISSION_3_OFFICER_INTRO_1,"Welcome, Commander. Apologies for the delays."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_INTRO_2,"We finally managed to set up a camp. Wasn't easy to gather troops after we lost controll of the army."
MISSION_3_OBJECTIVE,"Our objective is to take the City Hall. Local defense forces are still disorganized. We should use this window of opportunity."
MISSION_3_TANK_1,"Our militiants managed to steal a tank from nearby military base. It won't be long before someone notices."
MISSION_3_TANK_2,"Tanks are great at dealing with infantry - this one will be a valuble asset in this mission. Still, we need more if we are to succeed."
MISSION_3_TANK_FACTORY,"There is a tank fabrication facility nearby. Take it before the enemy uses those heavy units to stop our assault."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_FACTORY_CAP_1,"Great work, Commander. Nothing will stop us now."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_FACTORY_CAP_2,"Local defense forces ordered a tank recently. I guess it is ours now."
MISSION_3_OFFICER_FACTORY_AI,"Commander, this is not good! Local forces have taken active controll of this factory. We need to re-take it, or we will face a lot more tanks that we can handle."
MISSION_TITLE_BASE_ASSAULT,"基地急襲"
MISSION_DESR_BASE_ASSAULT,"最近の勝利は我々に足場を与えたが、我々はそこで止まることはできない。 近くの軍事基地には、使用できる設備がたくさんある！ 彼らがもはやこの地域を支配していないことに気づく前に、攻撃する必要がある。"
MISSION_4_OFFICER_INTRO_1,"Great work on securing a foothold Commander, but our work here is not yet done."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_INTRO_2,"If we are to secure our presence in this region, we have to take over the military base."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_INTRO_3,"Armoured units are available. Expect the enemy base to deploy tanks of their own!"
MISSION_4_OFFICER_LANDLINE_1,"We've managed to cut off their landline communications, Commander. We should be able to overwhelm them before they can even call for help."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_LANDLINE_2,"Still, we should not waste any time. They can still use comm towers."
MISSION_4_OFFICER_HELP_1,"This is perimeter base! We are under attack! Repeat, we are under attack!"
MISSION_4_OFFICER_HELP_2,"This is not good, they managed to restore communications. We have to prepare for reinforcements."
MISSION_4_RAPID_RESPONSE,"Rapid response unit reporting in!"
MISSION_4_FORWARD_BARRACK,"Capturing these forward barracks would allow us to bring soldiers to the front line more easily."
MISSION_4_GUARD_WARN,"Rebels are getting close!"
MISSION_4_COMM_CUT_1,"With both towers near their HQ we knocked out their comms completely."
MISSION_4_COMM_CUT_2,"What the... ? Command, come in. Anyone?"
MISSION_4_COMM_CUT_3,"Good luck with that."
MISSION_TITLE_PENINSULA,"半島"
MISSION_DESR_PENINSULA,"戦いの日々は最終的に成功している。 今、我々は強い隣国の支援を受けるようになった。 我々は、略奪者を半島から追い出す準備ができた。 我々が成功すると、彼らが奪還する方法はなくなる。 これが我々の最大の勝利になるだろう！"
MISSION_5_OFFICER_INTRO_1,"Government forces throughout the peninsula are busy fighting local militia."
MISSION_5_OFFICER_INTRO_2,"With a cooridnated push, we can take controll of this land before they can re-organize."
MISSION_5_OFFICER_INTRO_3,"This base safeguards a strategic route connecting the peninsula with the rest of the country. Taking controll of this facility will cut off all remaining army, forcing them to surrender."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_NEAR_1,"This is an airforce outpost meant to support the main base. Defences seem to be minimal, they did not expect an attack from this direction."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_NEAR_2,"We should claim this building for additional air support."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_CAP_1,"There is more equipment here, than we expected. They probably regret loosing this outpost already."
MISSION_5_AIRPORT_CAP_2,"Attack helicopter reporting for duty."
MISSION_5_FLANK,"With the right flank secured, we were able to bring in some reinforcements."
MISSION_5_BLOCK_1,"You will not get away with this, traitors!"
MISSION_5_BLOCK_2,"It is you, who betrayed our great President! Arrest him!"
MISSION_TITLE_RECAPTURE,"奪還"
MISSION_DESR_RECAPTURE,"状況は急速に悪化している。 我々は後退を開始しなければならない。さもないと、この紛争の進展をすべて失うことになる。 我々は反政府勢力が作戦を開始した都市を解放する準備が整っている。 我々の軍隊が単なる盗賊の相手にはならないことを、彼らや人々に示そう。"
MISSION_6_INTRO_1,"Welcome, Sir. As you may already know, recent setbacks have put us in an unfavourable position. We have to start pushing back."
MISSION_6_INTRO_2,"Our intel suggests, that this city is where it all started. Rebel activity appears to have lessened since the initial attack - they probably moved on."
MISSION_6_INTRO_3,"Still, we should not underestimate the garrison stationed here. Liberating this city will be an important step in our campaign."
MISSION_6_INTRO_4,"Sir, the base of operations is up and running."
MISSION_6_INTRO_5,"Good."
MISSION_6_INTRO_6,"Air support reporting in."
MISSION_6_INTRO_7,"We've got decent amount of ground units, though our air capabilities are limited for this engagement. Use these assets well."
MISSION_6_APP_BASE,"Sir, this looks like an abandoned rebel encampment. It seems they had no way of moving all this equipment, so they just left it."
MISSION_6_APP_TOWERS_1,"There are two comm towers on the left flank."
MISSION_6_APP_TOWERS_2,"There may be some AA emplacements in the area, but if we capture those towers, we will be able to guide in more air support safely."
MISSION_6_APP_TOWERS_3,"Anti-tank team has arrived."
MISSION_6_PATROL_1,"Patrol squad reporting back."
MISSION_6_PATROL_2,"No rest for you, we are under attack!"
MISSION_6_RED_HQ_1,"We are loosing ground! Warn the Commander!"
MISSION_6_RED_HQ_2,"Yes Sir!"
MISSION_6_RED_HQ_3,"He got away. Doesn't matter, let's focus on the mission at hand."
MISSION_TITLE_BASE_DEFENCE,"基地防衛"
MISSION_DESR_BASE_DEFENCE,"アラート！ 反乱軍が東部の軍事基地の1つを攻撃している！ 彼らが我々の資産をこれ以上獲得することを許すことはできない。 基地を防衛し、地域の反乱軍を破壊する！"
MISSION_7_INTRO_1,"Alarm! Unidentified troops spotted near the base perimeter!"
MISSION_7_INTRO_2,"They spotted us! Commence the attack!"
MISSION_7_INTRO_3,"Sir! We had reports of enemy movements in the area, but we did not expect them to organize so fast."
MISSION_7_INTRO_4,"And they are taking the auxilary barracks! Tank factory is probably being attacked as well. We have to protect our flanks."
MISSION_7_LEFT_CLAIMED,"Left flank secure."
MISSION_7_RIGHT_CLAIMED,"Right flank secure."
MISSION_7_TRAP,"We've got you now!"
MISSION_7_BASE_1,"You might think you are winning, but this is only a minor setback. We will be back, and in greater numbers!"
MISSION_7_BASE_2,"We will see about that."
MISSION_7_TOWERS_1,"We've managed to take over enemy communication line and intercept some chatter about plans on attacking an airport."
MISSION_7_TOWERS_2,"This cannot be good..."
MISSION_TITLE_AIRPORT_PT_1,"空港 パート1"
MISSION_DESR_AIRPORT_PT_1,"我々の民兵と政府軍の間の戦いは、我々が望んだように進んでいない。 我々がまだあきらめないことを、世界に示す必要がある。 近くの空港は戦略的に重要なものではないが、獲得することは、我々の威力を示すことになる！"
MISSION_8_INTRO_1,"Forward camp is ready, Commander."
MISSION_8_INTRO_2,"Commander, let's get going."
MISSION_8_INTRO_3,"This is the local airport. It is not of high strategic importance, but loosing it will strike fear into enemies hearts."
MISSION_8_FACTORIES,"Reiconessanse reports multiple tank factories in the area. Those helicopters will come really handy."
MISSION_8_APP_AIRPORT,"Target spotted."
MISSION_8_CAP_AIRPORT_1,"Objective achieved."
MISSION_8_CAP_AIRPORT_2,"Now let's clear this area of enemy units, we can't risk loosing this terminal."
MISSION_8_BUY_HELI_1,"Let's clear those tanks."
MISSION_8_BUY_HELI_2,"Commander, while searching the airport we have found some documents left by the enemy officers."
MISSION_8_BUY_HELI_3,"It is some kind of flight schedule, probably for military supplies. We will make good use of this."
MISSION_TITLE_AIRPLANE,"飛行機"
MISSION_DESR_AIRPLANE,"空港設備のおかげで、我々は、その地域を飛行する重要な軍用機に関する通信を傍受した。 我々はミサイル発射に最適な場所を特定したが、敵に守られている。 軍隊を集合して、輸送手段を撃墜する場所に入れ！"
MISSION_9_INTRO_1,"If the information we aquired is correct, there should be a military plane flying over this area soon."
MISSION_9_INTRO_2,"We have identified best position to set up our AA emplacement, but it is currently occupied by the enemy."
MISSION_9_INTRO_3,"Our camp is still being developed. We have to capture facilities available throughout the city to bolster our forces."
MISSION_9_TURN2_1,"Long range radar that we captured on the peninsula just reported it is tracking a vessel coming from the west."
MISSION_9_TURN2_2,"We still have plenty of time, but we have to finish our mission before the window of opportunity closes."
MISSION_9_TURN10_1,"The tracked vessel is closing in, we should hurry."
MISSION_9_TURN10_2,"We are also tracking a group of attack helicopters. They might be heading your way."
MISSION_9_TURN15_1,"The transport will be passing over any minute. We can still catch it."
MISSION_9_TURN15_2,"Eagle Squad ready for patrol duty... What is this? The base is under siege! Attack formation!"
MISSION_9_TURN18_1,"That airplane is already past our position. We have to prepare the attack now."
MISSION_9_TURN20_1,"The target is out of reach. We have failed, Commander."
MISSION_9_APP_HQ,"Closing in on the designated area. AA guns ready for deployment."
MISSION_TITLE_FIELD_COMMAND,"実施部隊司令部"
MISSION_DESR_FIELD_COMMAND,"これらの分離派は民間航空機を撃墜しただけで数百人が死亡した！ 彼らの暴力を止める必要がある！ 我々の偵察兵が、この地域の敵実施部隊司令部を発見した。 我々の資源は限られているが、近くの都市にもっと多くの人と戦車を集めることができるはずだ。"
MISSION_10_INTRO_1,"Those fanatics just destroyed a civilian plane full of people! With ground-to-air missiles! Where did they even got this kind of equipment?"
MISSION_10_INTRO_2,"We have to stop this madness before more people suffer."
MISSION_10_INTRO_3,"Recon, do you have anything for us?"
MISSION_10_INTRO_4,"Local command center located, Sir. Attempting infiltration..."
MISSION_10_INTRO_5,"Not so fast!"
MISSION_10_INTRO_6,"We have been spotted! I repeat..."
MISSION_10_INTRO_7,"Now they know we're here. Looks like we have to assault this base old-fashioned way."
MISSION_10_TOWER_1,"Comms established. Requesting backup."
MISSION_10_TOWER_2,"Somebody called?"
MISSION_10_HQ_1,"Closing in on enemy position. They are surrounded by mountains, nowhere to go!"
MISSION_10_HQ_2,"Enemy reinforcements detected!"
MISSION_TITLE_AIRPORT_PT_2,"空港 パート2"
MISSION_DESR_AIRPORT_PT_2,"反乱軍は、地方司令部を失った後に散在している。 空港は依然として厳重に守られているが、すぐに新しい援軍を受けることはない。 我々の偵察隊は小さな基地を確立した。 彼らが立ち上がれるようになる前に攻撃する必要がある！"
MISSION_11_INTRO_1,"Welcome back, Sir.  We have finally got a green light on re-taking that airport."
MISSION_11_INTRO_2,"This area is highly contested. Luckily, our recent victories forced our foe to re-group, so they can't expect help anytime soon."
MISSION_11_RECON_1,"This is recon. We have located enemy HQ. Looks like they are fortifying their position."
MISSION_11_RECON_2,"Moving out before they spot us."
MISSION_11_CAP_TOWER,"Sir, the forest road is blocked. It looks like we could clear it out if we brought a tank here."
MISSION_11_TANK,"Load main gun! Fire!"
MISSION_TITLE_CONVOY,"護送"
MISSION_DESR_CONVOY,"この時期の戦争に多くの人々が苦しんでいる。 我々の親切な隣人が、食糧、水、薬の人道救援物資を我々に送ることを提案した。 政府は我々の善意を信じておらず、トラックを通過させないだろう。 我々は道をクリアする必要がある！"
MISSION_12_INTRO_1,"The transports will be ready to go very soon."
MISSION_12_INTRO_2,"Nearby city really needs what's in these trucks. We have to secure the road."
MISSION_12_INTRO_3,"Capturing and holding these towers along the way should allow us to go safely."
MISSION_12_CROSSROAD_1,"This mountain pass is vital to our operation. We have to hold this position."
MISSION_12_CROSSROAD_2,"The enemy base is going to put a pressure on us from the flank. Take it out if you can, but do not compromise our mission, Commander."
MISSION_12_TOWERS_1,"Congratulations on securing the route. Now we should be able to co-ordinate our forces and defend the convoy."
MISSION_12_TOWERS_2,"They will not stop us."
MISSION_TITLE_CRASH_SITE,"墜落現場"
MISSION_DESR_CRASH_SITE,"我々が攻撃した飛行機が、、森の中深く落ちた。 我々は誰も墜落現場に到達することを許してはならない。 残骸がなければ、誰がどのように破壊したかをだれも証明することはできない。 国際捜査官が途上にあり、我々は彼らを止めなければならない。"
MISSION_13_INTRO_1,"Commander, I assume you already heard about our little... mistake."
MISSION_13_INTRO_2,"As it turns out, that military transport we shot down wasn't a military vessel at all."
MISSION_13_INTRO_3,"We have managed to blockade the crash site for now, but international investigators are on their way."
MISSION_13_INTRO_4,"Secure this position, Commander."
MISSION_13_TURN3_1,"Armoured column, move forward."
MISSION_13_TURN3_2,"Get out of our way, and we might just let you withdraw your forces... for now."
MISSION_13_TURN3_3,"Save your breath."
MISSION_13_HALF_WAY,"Sir, we have scouted an airfield near the enemy HQ. We have to be cautious when pushing with tanks."
MISSION_TITLE_AIRPORT_PT_3,"空港 パート3"
MISSION_DESR_AIRPORT_PT_3,"この惨めな空港で戦ってから数ヶ月が経った。 すべてが瓦礫になり、空港は跡形もなくなった - ターミナル、タワー、周辺の都市なども。 それでも、まだ誰がここで優位を持っているかのシンボルだ。そこは我々のものでなければならない！"
MISSION_14_INTRO_1,"My apologies, Commander. We lost the airport you previously secured. Enemy attack was switft and devastating."
MISSION_14_INTRO_2,"We don't have much footing here. Taking control of the barracks building on the other side of the forest is a good start."
MISSION_14_INTRO_3,"I've dispatched a couple of small squads to scout out the battlefield ahead."
MISSION_14_TURN2_1,"We have some initial reports."
MISSION_14_TURN2_2,"The old encampment is ruined, though some light weapons for infantry can be salvaged for training more troops."
MISSION_14_TURN2_3,"Tank factory has been abandoned when it lost power, but we should be able to restore basic functions."
MISSION_14_TURN3_1,"Most of the city is completely ruined."
MISSION_14_TURN3_2,"Airport buildings have been blown up, not much left in there. Military hangars seem fairly untouched, we should be able to use them."
MISSION_14_TURN4_1,"We have visual confirmation on one of the enemy encampments. Looks like their command centre is not here."
MISSION_14_TURN4_2,"I think they spotted us, falling back."
MISSION_14_TURN4_3,"It's a trap!"
MISSION_14_TRAP_1,"Commander, we have found explosive traps in most of the buildings. They really didn't want us to capture it."
MISSION_14_TRAP_2,"And it seems, that explosions alerted them. Expect increased resistance."
